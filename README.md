# BAMAZON

Bamazon is a small scale sales app. 
Using node, mysql and inquirer.js, we can create, delete, update and edit a stores inventory, 
watch its stock, sell, troubleshoot, retain info and keep up with supply and demand all in one interface.

Upon opening Bamazon, the app will ask your name for a more user friendly, personal shopping experience. 



From there, the user can browse the inventory
